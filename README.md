Warehouse Robot Simulation

(Project from January to May 2024)

This project involved designing a simple search-based agents solving transportation tasks in a virtual (MAvis) environment with efficient algorithm designs and heuristics, such as greedy, a-star, and goal-count. 
The goal was to adapt an idealized model of systems of delivery robots in hospitals and warehouse agents at Amazon.
